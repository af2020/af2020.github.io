눈이 많이 왔다. 
Polar Express를 타고 눈위를 달리는 아이의 마음으로 하루를 살자.

The Polar Express - Tom Hanks


  
  


All aboard! All aboard!
Tickets please, tickets 
Well, you coming?

It's a magic carpet on a rail 
Never takes a rest
Flying through the mountains and the snow
Ride for free and join the fun 
(You can ride for free) 
If you just say yes! 
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the Polar Express
You bet!

Wooo wooo the whistle blows 
That's the sound of her singing 
Ding ding the bell will ring 
Golly look at her go!

You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess 
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the Polar Express

When we get there we'll scream Yes!? (Yeah)
We'll arrive with a bang bang bang 
boom boom boom
Laughing all the way!

It's a choo choo with a stunning view 
That rivals all the best
But you won't see it advertised 
It's a simple fact we stay on track 
Though sometimes we digress
But that can only happen on the Polar Express

Hiss hiss the steam hisses
That's the sound of her breathing
Clang clang the boiler bangs
What a wonderful show!

With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy is this the best!
Wish it wouldn't ever have to end
With a little luck we'll be on time
There's no need to stress
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the Polar Express

Lights are gleaming far across the snow
You're not dreaming 
May I present the North Pole!
If it's penguins you expect to view
You surely haven't guessed 
They all live down at the other end

With a little luck we'll be on time
There's no need to stress
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the Polar Express

Boom boom the whistle blows 
That's the sound of her singing
Ding ding the bell will ring 
Golly look at her go!
If you want to join us come along
I'll check my manifest
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the Polar Express

When we get there we'll scream ?Yes!? (Yeah)
We'll arrive with a bang bang bang boom boom boom
Laughing all the way
If you want to join us come along
You can be our guest 
Cause that's the way things happen 
On the roller coaster the Polar Express
Next stop One Hundred and Thirteen Forty-Four 
Edbrook Avenue
Next stop One Hundred and Thirteen Forty-Four 
Edbrook Avenue

Ahh ahhh ahh that is not a toy young man 
That is not a toy
Take your seats please
Take your seats
