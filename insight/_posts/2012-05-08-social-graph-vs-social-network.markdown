위키피디아에서 Social graph를 찾아보니 아래와 같이 Social network 과 Social graph를 비교하고 있다. Social graph라는 용어가 Facebook conference에서 주커버크가 사용해서 유명해진 용어였군. 일반적으로 통용되고 있다면 알아두는 것이 좋을 듯. social graph는 온라인, social network은 오프라인 이렇게 간단히 비교했구나. 앞부분 개요만 인용.


<blockquote>The social graph is a term coined by scientists working in the social areas of graph theory. It has been described as "the global mapping of everybody and how they're related".[1] The term was popularized at the Facebook f8 conference on May 24, 2007, when it was used to explain that the Facebook Platform, which was introduced at the same time, would benefit from the social graph by taking advantage of the relationships between individuals, that Facebook provides, to offer a richer online experience.[2] The definition has been expanded to refer to a social graph of all Internet users.[3]
A graph is an abstract concept used in discrete mathematics; the social graph describes the relationships between individuals online, as opposed to the concept of a social network, which describes relationships in the real world. The two concepts are very similar, but some minor differences do exist. For example, the social graph is digital, and more importantly, it is defined explicitly by all connections involved.[3] Since explaining the concept of the social graph, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, has often touted Facebook's goal of offering the website's social graph to other websites so that a user's relationships can be made aware and put to use on websites outside of Facebook's control.[4]
A social graph is a sociogram which depicts all personal relations - typically not more than 100 per person.</blockquote>
